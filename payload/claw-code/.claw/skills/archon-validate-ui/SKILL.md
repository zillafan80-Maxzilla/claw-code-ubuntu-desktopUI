# Archon Web UI — Comprehensive E2E Validation

Run exhaustive end-to-end browser automation tests and codebase review of the Archon Web UI.
The goal: determine whether Archon is doing the best it possibly can to solve the problem of
managing parallel agents, executing custom workflows, and providing full visibility into agent work.

Optional focus argument: `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g., "workflows", "chat", "projects"). If empty, run ALL sections.

---

## Phase 0: Environment Setup

### 0.1 Kill Old Archon Processes

```bash
# Kill any running Archon dev servers (backend + frontend)
pkill -f "bun.*dev:server" 2>/dev/null || true
pkill -f "bun.*dev:web" 2>/dev/null || true
pkill -f "bun.*packages/server" 2>/dev/null || true
pkill -f "bun.*packages/web" 2>/dev/null || true
pkill -f "vite.*5173" 2>/dev/null || true

# Kill any leftover processes on our ports
lsof -ti:3090 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# Wait for ports to free up
sleep 2

# Verify ports are free
! lsof -i:3090 && ! lsof -i:5173 && echo "Ports 3090 and 5173 are free" || echo "WARNING: Ports still in use"
```

### 0.2 Install agent-browser (if needed)

```bash
# Check if agent-browser is available
which agent-browser 2>/dev/null || npx agent-browser --version 2>/dev/null

# If not installed globally, install it:
# npm install -g agent-browser && agent-browser install
# On WSL2/Linux, use --with-deps to get Chromium system dependencies:
# agent-browser install --with-deps

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT use bunx — Bun skips postinstall scripts that agent-browser needs.
# Use npx or global npm install.
```

### 0.3 Start Archon Backend + Frontend

Start both services. Backend must be up before frontend SSE connections work.

```bash
# From the repo root: /path/to/archon

# Start backend (port 3090)
cd /path/to/archon && bun run dev:server &
sleep 5  # Wait for server initialization + DB

# Verify backend is healthy
curl -s http://localhost:3090/api/health | head -c 200

# Start frontend (port 5173)
cd /path/to/archon && bun run dev:web &
sleep 5  # Wait for Vite dev server

# Verify frontend is serving
curl -s http://localhost:5173 | head -c 200
```

**URLs:**
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:3090/api`
- SSE streams: `http://localhost:3090/api/stream/{conversationId}` (bypasses Vite proxy in dev)

### 0.4 Seed Test Data (if needed)

Check if there are existing codebases and conversations. If empty, create test data:

```bash
# Check existing codebases
curl -s http://localhost:3090/api/codebases | python3 -m json.tool 2>/dev/null || curl -s http://localhost:3090/api/codebases

# Register the current repo as a codebase (if none exist)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3090/api/codebases \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path": "/path/to/archon"}'

# Create a test conversation
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3090/api/conversations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' | python3 -m json.tool 2>/dev/null
```

## Phase 1: Browser Automation — End-to-End Testing

Use the `agent-browser` CLI for all browser interactions. Follow the snapshot-refs workflow:
1. `agent-browser open <url>` — navigate
2. `agent-browser snapshot -i` — get interactive elements with refs
3. Interact using refs (click, fill, etc.)
4. Re-snapshot after navigation or DOM changes

Take screenshots at each major test point: `agent-browser screenshot /tmp/archon-test-{name}.png`

## Phase 2: Codebase Review

Read the source code of every component and module listed below. For each, evaluate:
- **Correctness**: Are there logic bugs, race conditions, or broken state transitions?
- **UX quality**: Does the component provide good feedback, handle edge cases, feel polished?
- **Performance**: Are there unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization, or expensive operations?
- **Accessibility**: Are interactive elements properly labeled? Keyboard navigable?
- **Error handling**: Are errors caught, displayed, and recoverable?

### Key Question to Answer

> **Is Archon currently doing the best it possibly can to solve the problem of managing a lot of agents in parallel and executing custom workflows with full visibility?**

Specifically evaluate:
- Can users easily see what all their agents are doing at a glance?
- Is workflow status visible and understandable without clicking through multiple pages?
- Can users quickly navigate between the orchestrator chat, individual workflow runs, and task logs?
- Is the experience of kicking off a workflow through the router intuitive?
- Are parallel agents presented clearly with their individual status?
- Does the UI surface errors and issues prominently enough?
- Is the overall information architecture logical for someone managing 5-10 concurrent agents?

---

## Execution Notes

- Run all `agent-browser` commands via the Bash tool
- Use `npx agent-browser` if not installed globally
- After each navigation, re-snapshot (`agent-browser snapshot -i`) to get fresh refs
- Take screenshots liberally — save to `/tmp/archon-test-{section}-{name}.png`
- If a test fails, document it immediately and continue to the next test
- Use `agent-browser wait --load networkidle` after actions that trigger API calls
- For SSE testing, use `agent-browser eval` to check EventSource state
- Remember: WSL2 headless mode works fine — no display server needed
- Close the browser session when done: `agent-browser close`
